`hackclub/dinosaurs` is maintained by a crack team of internation pull request mergers fulfilling a tour of duty for 2 months. The current tour of duty is scheduled to end on **Aug 31st**.

Maintainers fulfill the following role:

**Merging PRs**

- Every new PR that comes in should get a review within a day.
- Leave a comment! If someone put effort into their drawing let them know we appreciate it!
- Bias for merging PRsâ€“ many are submitting their first PR and we want to make sure they have a good experience, not get caught up in a typo or extra newline.
