**Prophet Orpheus**

_The Dinosaur Who Can Never Look Back_

    or else that means acknowledging [her] past and accepting the fate of the dinosaurs
    right now, [she] is still able to exist through the engagement of modern constructions
    like reading books and chasing after money
    only ever living in the present
    engaging with the idea that [she's] still alive
    Much like [her] Greek namesake, who couldn't give up on the idea that his wife is dead
    until he is finally forced to "look back"
