**Prophet Orpheus**

_The Dinosaur Who Can Never Look Back_

    or else that means acknowledging its past and accepting the fate of the dinosaurs
    right now, it is still able to exist through the engagement of modern constructions
    like reading books and chasing after money
    only ever living in the present
    engaging with the idea that it's still alive
    Much like its Greek namesake, who couldn't give up on the idea that his wife is dead
    until he is finally forced to "look back"
